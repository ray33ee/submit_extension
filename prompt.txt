Make an extension which disables the 'Submit' button on certain webpages. 

Make no assumptions about the structure of the webpage, only reject buttons if they have 'Submit' in their inner text (case sensitive). 

This should be implemented by a) removing the submit button and b) creating a box of the same dimensions in the same place.

This box should be a yellow square that has a message called DISABLED.

Clicking the yellow square should show a message box saying 'Submit button is disabled by extension. Click extension to enable'

The extension should have an icon which can be clicked on, like most modern extensions. This should bring a popup that allows the user to reenable (and hence delete the yellow square and add the button back).
